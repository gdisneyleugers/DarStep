/**
 * The DKNotificationCenter class allows Objective-C objects to watch for
 * notifications from other D-Bus objects ('signals' in the D-Bus dialect) or to
 * post notifications to D-Bus themselves. You can use this class just as you
 * would use an NSNotificationCenter. Notification names will be mapped to
 * signals as follows: If the introspection data for theD-Bus signal carries an
 * <code>org.gnustep.openstep.notification</code> annotation ,the value of this
 * annotation will be used as the name of the notification. Otherwise, the
 * notification name will be
 * <code>DKSignal_&lt;InterfaceName&gt;_&lt;SignalName&gt;</code>.
 *
 * Additionally, D-Bus provides a rather sophisticated matching mechanism to
 * catch only signal emissions with a specific signature. This mechanism is
 * available to applications through the
 * -addObserver:selector:signal:interface:sender:destination: method and its
 * more specific variants. Unfortunately, at this time, you need to specify
 * identical match rules when removing the observer again.
 *
 * Every notification from D-Bus carries a reference to a proxy for the object
 * emitting the signal and also guarantees that the following keys are present
 * in the dictionary:
 * <deflist>
 * <term>member</term><desc>The name of the signal being emitted (e.g.
 * "NameOwnerChanged"</desc>
 * <term>interface</term><desc>The name of the interface to which the signal
 * belongs. (e.g. "org.freedesktop.DBus").</desc>
 * <term>sender</term><desc>The service emitting the signal (e.g.
 * "org.freedesktop.DBus"). This will always be the unique name of the service,
 * even if you registered the signal for another name.</desc>
 * <term>path</term><desc>The path to the object emitting the signal (e.g
 * "/org/freedesktop/DBus").</desc>
 * <term>destination</term><desc>The intended receiver of the signal, might be
 * empty if the signal was broadcast, which is usually the case.</desc>
 * </deflist>
 * Additionally the userInfo dictionary will contain keys for every argument
 * specified in the signal, named "arg<em>N</em>". The dictionary might also
 * contain further keys if <code>org.gnustep.openstep.notification.key</code>
 * annotations were available.
